Date Range Selection: You can select a start date and an end date using date pickers. The end date's minimum allowed value is set based on the selected start date.

Excluded Dates: You can specify excluded dates by selecting them on the date picker. Excluded dates are used to calculate the number of days.

Number of Days: The application calculates the number of days between the selected start and end dates, excluding the specified excluded dates.

Lead Count: You can input the lead count, and the application calculates the expected DRR. The expected DRR is the lead count divided by the number of days.

Save and Cancel: You can save the input data, including start date, end date, lead count, and excluded dates, and display it in a table. There's also an option to cancel the input.
